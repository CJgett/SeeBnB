# Depth First Search 
When employing Depth-First Search (DFS), also known as last in, first out (LIFO), the node that was last added to the tree is chosen as the next to be explored. This leads to a tree where the depth is explored first.

## Implementation
[comment]: <> (TODO insert code) 
```javascript
console.log("this time its LIFO");
```
