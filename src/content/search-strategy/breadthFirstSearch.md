# Breadth First Search 
A common counterpart to DFS, Breadth First Search (BFS) chooses the node which was first added to the list as the next node, hence it is also known as first in, first out (FIFO). New nodes are appended to the end of the problem list, and the next node is plucked from the front, creating a tree which grows level-by-level.

## Implementation
[comment]: <> (TODO insert code) 
```javascript
console.log("this time its FIFO");
```
